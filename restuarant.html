    <h2 class="fade"> Our Story</h2>
    
    <pre id="pre" class="fade">
     Belisima Semilla was a beautiful
     young woman and she dispised cooking.

     It was only after she met her soul mate 
     who loved food was she forced to cook for him and
     that was the beggining of Semilla restuarants. 
     Her food became the talk of the town and 
     after eloping and opening a small eatery(which they also lived in) 
     crowds would gather in pursuit of the amazing
     smells and equisite dishes made by Belisima, 
     so to celebrate her cooking and 
     her great love story,
     the semalli family has kept the restuarants
     running with the aim of spreading 
     to the whole world and expanding Belisima's legacy.</pre>
